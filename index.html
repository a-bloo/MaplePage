        <!-- Content about me -->
        <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Kabin Yang</strong>, a software engineer with a passion for building and nurturing online communities, especially in the gaming world.</p>
        <p>
          My first online experience began with <strong>MapleStory</strong>, where I discovered the joy of being part of an online community where everyone shares a common interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to think that I took what I learned from that experience and applied it as a streamer creating my own communities as well as helping fellow content creators by moderating their streams and even Discord servers. I helped create a safe and inclusive place where people can come to enjoy a community of people with similar interests, just like how I first experienced <strong>MapleStory</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am truly excited about the prospect of bringing my expertise in community dynamics, content development, and user interaction to the Community Manager role at Nexon. I aim to leverage my experience to foster a vibrant community around <strong>Nexon's</strong> franchises.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm off-screen, I am an avid artist, engaging in digital art and sculpting, which keeps my creative juices flowing and gives me new and exciting perspectives that I can bring back into the gaming world.
